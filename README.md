![Video demo of the site: two fists drawn in the style of emojis with knuckle tattoos that read "cool site" across the fingers. The text is then edited to read: "boss baby" and the skin color of the fists is cycled through the standard set of emoji options. Finally, the text "fork code" is written across the knuckles, before it is all reset back to the start.](./demo.gif)
